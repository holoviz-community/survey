I am also not a fan of separating options into parameters and options that have to be added with .opts(opts.Scatter(...)) or whatever. It's just so much boilerplate for really nothing. Please make more complete docstrings. It's usually tough to understand what options are available. Also, currently, it's a nightmare or impossible to get frame-by-frame or axis-by-axis scaling if you have combinations of layouts, overlays, and dynamic maps. Also, currently, there are a lot of ""hacks."" Getting a dotted line plot, getting numbers on a heatmap, making a line fit on a scatter plot, getting error bands, making a histogram, also please rename ""Distribution"" to something like ""KDEPlot"" and make it accept 1D and 2D data.

Please also look into Seaborn to get inspiration for features: automatic error bands and automatic curve fits... also please add a candlestick chart type (with no gaps for times when there weren't any candles, as it's standard in finance). Also: dot size legend, make legend title for overlays easier, make it easier to decouple axes scaling and panning, make it possible to only decouple the x or y axis in hvplot, make it easier to add a single title to a set of plots and a single legend to a set of plots, make it easier / possible to save whole layouts of plots as vector graphics (SVG). Something easy to manipulate plot size / position in a layout would be nice, like a simple option that automatically puts everything in a FastgridTemplate, and then a button to spit out the code that makes those positions permanent.",10.0,Yes,,,Bokeh,Yes,I don't use Python scripts,,,1.0

I'd also like to see perhaps a Slack or Discord community, I think that would be pretty good!
